      <h2>The Importance of Faith-Based Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        Faith-based recovery programs integrate spiritual support with practical
        resources to promote healing of the mind, body, and soul. These
        approaches can provide a sense of hope, belonging, and accountability,
        while helping individuals build resilience through their faith
        communities. For many, spirituality offers strength during the most
        difficult parts of recovery.
