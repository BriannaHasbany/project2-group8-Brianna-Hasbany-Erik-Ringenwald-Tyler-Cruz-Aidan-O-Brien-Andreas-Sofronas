        <h2>What We Treat</h2>
        <p>
          Mental Health Disorder (MHD):
          Mental Health Disorder is a condition that affects a person’s thinking, mood, or behavior, making it difficult to manage
          daily life. It can include things like anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, or PTSD. Just like physical illnesses,
          these disorders can range from mild to severe and often require support, therapy, or medication to help a person feel
          better and function well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Substance use Disorder (SUD):
          Substance Use Disorder is when someone has trouble controlling their use of alcohol, drugs, or other substances, even
          when it causes problems in their life. It can make it hard for them to stop, lead to strong cravings, and impact their
          health, relationships, and work. It’s more than just occasional use—it’s a pattern that can take over and require help
          to manage or overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Health Equity:
          Health equity ensures that everyone, including people with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) or Mental Health Disorders
          (MHD), has access to the care, support, and resources they need to achieve their best health. Many individuals with SUD
          or MHD face barriers like stigma, discrimination, and limited access to treatment, which can worsen their conditions. By
          promoting health equity, we help reduce these barriers, provide fair opportunities for recovery, and improve overall
          well-being, regardless of a person’s background or circumstances.
